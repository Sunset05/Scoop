# Features
Welcome to Scoop, on this webpage you can check out some of the recipes in my cookbook, and if you are feeling hungry, you can scoop those ingredients into a shopping cart. You can then navigate to your shopping cart and see a generated grocy list of all of the ingredients neded to prepare your meal.


# To-do List:
    - add a create recipe component that saves to front end and back end
    - add a recipe scraping component that accepts a url and returns the ingredients from that website

# Inspiration
The inspiration for this project came from my inneficiency when needing to create grocery shopping lists. I am the person that likes to have a list written down and I wanted to create an appliaction that does this for me.
